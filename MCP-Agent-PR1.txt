Based on the sources and our conversation history, here is a potential roadmap and steps for an "app project" focusing on automating infrastructure deployment using Terraform, Azure, and GitHub, incorporating best practices discussed in the materials.

This roadmap outlines the key stages and activities, drawing directly from the provided sources.

**App Project Roadmap: Automated Infrastructure Deployment**

The core idea is to use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform to define and provision your application's infrastructure on Azure, automate deployments using GitHub Actions, and manage state securely.

**Phase 1: Initial Setup and Local Infrastructure Development**

This phase focuses on getting the necessary tools configured and developing the initial infrastructure code locally.

*   **Step 1: Install Terraform Locally**
    Install Terraform on your local machine by downloading the latest version from the official Terraform website.
*   **Step 2: Set up Project Repository and Files**
    Create a directory for your Terraform code (e.g., `appservice_tf_quickstart`) and make it the current directory. Inside this directory, create a Terraform file, typically named `main.tf`.
*   **Step 3: Write Initial Infrastructure Code**
    Begin writing your infrastructure configuration in `main.tf` using Terraform's declarative language. Define the Azure provider and basic resources required for your project, such as a Resource Group and potentially a Storage Account for later use.
*   **Step 4: Initialize and Test Locally**
    Run `terraform init` in your project directory to initialize Terraform, download providers, and prepare the working directory. Create an execution plan to preview changes with `terraform plan`. Apply the plan to provision resources locally with `terraform apply`.

**Phase 2: Setting up Remote State Backend in Azure**

Storing Terraform state locally is not ideal for team collaboration, securing sensitive information, or preventing accidental deletion. Setting up a remote backend like Azure Storage is crucial.

*   **Step 1: Create Azure Resources for State Storage**
    You need specific resources in your Azure account to store the Terraform state file.
    *   Create an Azure subscription (the billing and access control unit).
    *   Create a Resource Group to logically group the storage resources.
    *   Create an Azure Storage Account to serve as the store for the Terraform Remote State file. Note: storage account names must be globally unique.
    *   Create an Azure Storage container within the storage account. Blob storage containers are suitable for storing unstructured data like a Terraform state file.
    These resources can be created manually through the Azure portal or programmatically. Resources created manually initially won't be tracked by Terraform.
*   **Step 2: Configure Terraform Backend in Code**
    Modify your `main.tf` or create a separate backend configuration file to tell Terraform to use Azure Storage as the backend. Include the `azurerm` backend block with `resource_group_name`, `storage_account_name`, `container_name`, and `key` (the desired name for the state file, e.g., `terraform.tfstate`).
*   **Step 3: Re-initialize with Backend Configuration**
    Run `terraform init` again. Terraform will detect the backend configuration and prompt you to migrate your local state to the configured Azure blob.
*   **Step 4: Understand State Locking and Encryption**
    Be aware that Azure Storage automatically locks blobs during write operations to prevent concurrent state modifications and corruption. Data stored in Azure Blob Storage is automatically encrypted at rest.

**Phase 3: Implementing Application Infrastructure as Code**

Expand your Terraform configuration to define the specific Azure resources needed for your application (e.g., App Service Plan, App Service App, Database, Networking, etc.).

*   Use the `azurerm` provider to define these resources using HCL syntax.
*   Structure your Terraform code logically within your repository.

**Phase 4: Setting up Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions**

Automate the process of validating, planning, and applying infrastructure changes using a CI/CD pipeline.

*   **Step 1: Secure Azure Access Credentials**
    Avoid hardcoding access keys. Store your Azure Storage account access key (or preferably a more secure method like a Service Principal with appropriate roles or managed identity) as a GitHub secret. Go to your GitHub repo settings, navigate to `Secrets and Variables` -> `Actions`, and add a new repository secret (e.g., named `STATE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`). Remember to update this secret if the Azure key is rotated. Using an environment variable (`ARM_ACCESS_KEY`) to pass this key to Terraform prevents it from being written to disk.
*   **Step 2: Define GitHub Actions Workflow**
    Create a workflow file in your repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`) to define the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Name the workflow (e.g., 'Terraform').
    *   Specify events that trigger the workflow (e.g., push to the main branch, pull requests).
    *   Define a job (e.g., 'terraform') that runs on a suitable runner (e.g., `ubuntu-latest`).
    *   Include steps for the workflow:
        *   Checkout the repository code (`uses: actions/checkout@v3`).
        *   Initialize Terraform (`name: Terraform Init`, `run: terraform init`), ensuring the Azure access key is passed via the environment variable `ARM_ACCESS_KEY` using the GitHub secret (`env: ARM_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.STATE_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY }}`).
        *   Create a Terraform plan (`name: Terraform Plan`, `run: terraform plan`), also using the access key.
        *   Apply Terraform changes (`name: Terraform Apply`, `run: terraform apply -auto-approve -input=false`). This step is typically configured to run automatically on merges to the main branch.
*   **Step 3: Integrate with GitHub Environments (Optional but Recommended)**
    Create GitHub environments (e.g., `production`, `staging`, `development`) to represent your deployment targets. Configure environment protection rules (e.g., required reviewers, wait timers, restricting deployments to specific branches/tags) and environment-specific secrets. Reference these environments in your workflow jobs. Jobs will only proceed after environment protection rules are satisfied.
*   **Step 4: Trigger and Verify the Pipeline**
    Commit and push your workflow file and updated Terraform code to the GitHub repository to trigger the Actions workflow. Monitor the workflow run in the GitHub Actions tab of your repository. Verify that the Terraform state file is successfully uploaded to the Azure Storage container after the workflow runs.

**Phase 5: Integrating with Azure Policy (Optional)**

Ensure your deployed infrastructure complies with organizational standards and regulatory requirements using Azure Policy.

*   **Step 1: Treat Policies as Code**
    Manage your Azure Policy definitions and initiative definitions as source code within your repository.
*   **Step 2: Automate Policy Deployment**
    Implement a workflow (potentially within the same GitHub Actions pipeline or a separate one) to automatically deploy your policy definitions and assignments to Azure from source control.
*   **Step 3: Test and Validate Policies**
    Assign new or updated policies to a non-production environment first, using `enforcementMode` set to `disabled`. This allows auditing for compliance without blocking resource creation/updates. Use compliance data to validate that resources are evaluated as expected.
*   **Step 4: Implement and Test Remediation**
    For policies with `deployIfNotExists` or `modify` effects, configure and grant the policy assignment's managed identity the necessary roles for remediation. Test remediation tasks against non-compliant resources to ensure they successfully bring resources into compliance.
*   **Step 5: Enable Policy Enforcement**
    Once policies and remediation are validated, update the assignments to use `enforcementMode` enabled, starting with non-production environments and gradually moving towards production.
*   **Step 6: Integrate Policy Evaluation into Deployment Workflows**
    Include a step in your application/infrastructure deployment pipelines to perform a policy evaluation after deployment to catch non-compliance early, even if `enforcementMode` is disabled in that environment.

**Phase 6: Ongoing Development, Maintenance, and Best Practices**

Continuously refine your infrastructure code, update policies, and maintain security.

*   **Version Control Strategy:** Choose a suitable Git branching strategy (e.g., Trunk-Based Development with tags, GitHub Flow, or GitLab Flow) based on your team's size, release cadence, and requirements for supporting multiple versions. Treat environment branches as pointers to commits on the main branch if using them to trigger deployments.
*   **Secure State Storage:** Apply security best practices to your Azure Storage account holding the Terraform state, such as enabling soft deletes, versioning, point-in-time restore, redundancy (LRS, GRS), resource locks to prevent accidental deletion, IP restrictions, and using managed identities for access instead of access keys in production.
*   **Code Management:** Organize Terraform code for modules and reusable components.
*   **Monitoring and Auditing:** Implement monitoring for your infrastructure deployments and audit logs for changes.
*   **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update your Terraform code, CI/CD pipelines, and Azure Policies.


# at the last phase please make sure we do have a proper decomisiioning workflow to remove all the resources from azure
